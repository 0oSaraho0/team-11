## TYPOGRAPHY
- Ubuntu is the font used for the body with sans serif used as a fallback font.
- The Ubuntu font has been selected as I feel as though it has a similar feel to the font used in the logo, whilst also remaining clear to read.
- Different font weights have been used for various parts of the website.
- Most of the content is white text and a dark background

## UX/UI SECTION  
### Project Goals:
-  The goal of this project is to create a fun star wars themed escape room game. The site should be easy to navigate through, consistent with design, as well as make users want to visit again. It should be aesthetically pleasing with all text being clear to read, all generating a good user experience.  

### Design Choices:
- The colour scheme of the website as a whole:
    - A dark space themed background with white text. This is to mimic a star wars theme as its set in space with different planets and galaxies. 

- The structure of the website: 
    - As all good websites have, each page will have a navigation menu at the top of the page. This will contain the headings play, how to play, and meet the team. This repetition is said to make user experiences better as users like it when a website has a common theme/layout, so that it then becomes quick and easy to learn and navigate through.
    - The first page is naturally the home page. This will have the title of the game along with a play button

- The content provided in the website:
